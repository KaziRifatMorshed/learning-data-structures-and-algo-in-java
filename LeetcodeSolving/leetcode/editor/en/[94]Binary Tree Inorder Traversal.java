Given the root of a binary tree, return the inorder traversal of its nodes' 
values. 

 
 Example 1: 

 
 Input: root = [1,null,2,3] 
 

 Output: [1,3,2] 

 Explanation: 

 

 Example 2: 

 
 Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,null,8,null,null,6,7,9] 
 

 Output: [4,2,6,5,7,1,3,9,8] 

 Explanation: 

 

 Example 3: 

 
 Input: root = [] 
 

 Output: [] 

 Example 4: 

 
 Input: root = [1] 
 

 Output: [1] 

 
 Constraints: 

 
 The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 100]. 
 -100 <= Node.val <= 100 
 

 
Follow up: Recursive solution is trivial, could you do it iteratively?
