 Implementation of different page replacement algorithm.
 1) Optimal 2) FIFO 3) Second Chance  4) NRU


For each algorithm
Input
	Number of pages to be referenced
             Page sequence
             Number of frame
             reference bit status of pages in frame (only for Second Chance)
             reference and modification bit status of pages in frame (only for NRU)
Output
	Sequential graphical presentation of frame (how page replacement occurs)
             Number of page faults
